# Final project: THNX [View Live &#10555;](https://thnx.netlify.app/)

This is the final project of the Technigo Bootcamp 22/23. We have made a gratitude journal where the user can submit 3 daily gratefulness thoughts: These three thought are stored and previous thoughts can be viewed, only by the user. The projects includes backend and frontend.

## The problem

We started off by creating a pitch of our project including:
- Overall idea
- Technological stack needed
- List of pages
- Roadmap of the development process
    - Week 0-1: Sketch frontend and backend structure. Created backend with database modeling and endpoints.
    - Week 2: User interface sketch. Connected backend to the frontend. Testing the functionality.
    - Week 3: Styling, responsiveness, testing. Demo preparation. (CELEBRATION!)
- Minimum viable product & strech goals: blue üîµ, red üî¥ and black ‚ö´Ô∏è colour-code features.
- Design idea.

ADD FIGMA SOMEWHERE

As soon as we got the pitch approved we created a board with tickets to solve and ticked them off one by one. When we got stuck and had emptied all of our own resources we frequently used the help chanels provided, live Q&A with code coaches and Stack Overflow Team. 

If we had more time:
- Rebuild the project in React native to make it even more easy to use for the user and looking better on phone
- Daily reminder by E-mail or SMS
