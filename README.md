# Final project: THNX [View Live &#10555;](https://thnx.netlify.app/)

This is the final project of the Technigo Bootcamp 22/23 by Linda Norberg and Sofia Andersson. We have made a gratitude journal where the user can submit 3 daily gratefulness thoughts: These three thought are stored and previous thoughts can be viewed, only by the user. The projects includes backend and frontend.

## The problem

We started off by creating a pitch of our project in figma including:
- Overall idea
- Technological stack needed
- List of pages
- Roadmap of the development process
    - Week 0-1: Sketch frontend and backend structure. Created backend with database modeling and endpoints
    - Week 2: User interface sketch. Connected backend to the frontend. Testing the functionality
    - Week 3: Styling, responsiveness, testing. Demo preparation. (CELEBRATION!)
- Minimum viable product & stretch goals: blue üîµ, red üî¥ and black ‚ö´Ô∏è colour-code features
- Design idea

As soon as we got the pitch approved we created a board in figma with tickets to solve and ticked them off one by one. When we got stuck and had emptied all of our own resources we frequently used the help chanels provided, live Q&A with code coaches and Stack Overflow Team. 

If we had more time:
- Rebuild the project in React native to make it even more easy to use for the user and looking better on phone
- Daily reminder by E-mail or SMS
- Elaborate the historical overview in the previous thnx page
- Add written rewards on continuous writing, gamification/ challenges
- Improve user account settings
- Optional colourscheme

Keys to success:
- Scheduled physical workout breaks to regain focus and maintain efficiency
- Limit the scope according to available resources
- Dare to ask questions, better a stupid question than no answers
- Planning, a clear overall structure but keeping flexibility throughout the process
- Good collaboration

## TECH used:
- React
- Redux
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Styled Components
- Figma
- SweetAlert 
- Lotties
